# search-algorithms-comparison

Intelligent systems coursework from 2nd year of university, where the goal was to model the Blocksworld tile puzzle, implement 4 different search methods (Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Iterative Deepening Search, and A* Search) and compare their scalability.

The Blocksworld puzzle consists of a grid of blocks, some of which are lettered, and an agent, which can move blocks by swapping positions with them. The aim is to reach a goal state, where the lettered blocks are stacked on top of each other in alphabetical order, from a starting state.

Scalability was measured by adjusting the number of moves required to reach the goal state from the start state.
